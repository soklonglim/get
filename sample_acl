The UNIX file system protection scheme does not allow for fine-grained control over access using only the standard user(u), group(g), and others(o) protection bits. For example, its not possible using only these bits to grant one set of users read access, a second set of users write access, and a third set of users both read and write access. Further, while the group bits may suffice, using these access bits typically requires intervention by the super-user. However, the SETUID and SETGID bits can sometimes be used to provide finer-grained control when it is desired. In this assignment, you will create a “get” command that allow a user to provide finer-grained control over access to their files without the intervention of the super-user.

This is just a testing input file. Nothing else
