Release 4.0, Jul 27, 2017

This is a major release and brings significant new functionality: local
higher-order clustering, counting of temporal motifs, node embedding with
node2vec, locality sensitive hashing, K nearest neighbor graph construction,
fast object loading using memory mapped files, and sparse attributes.

Here is a detailed list:

- implemented local higher-order clustering, see examples/localmotifcluster
- implemented counting of temporal motifs, see examples/temporalmotifs
- implemented node embedding with node2vec, see examples/node2vec
- implemented locality sensitive hashing, see examples/lshtest
- implemented K nearest neighbor graph construction, see
